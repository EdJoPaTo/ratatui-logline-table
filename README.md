# Ratatui Logline Widget

Fork of the ratatui table widget made for rendering huge amounts of log lines.
Autoscrolls down as more log entries come in.

Built for the specific use case of [`mqttui`](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/mqttui).
Should work for other projects too.
Could be published on <https://crates.io> but as long as I am the only user I don't see much benefit.
Feel free to open an issue.
